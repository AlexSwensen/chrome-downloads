# chrome-downloads
Archive of Chrome packages for download - current and older Chrome versions are available, starting with Chrome 48.

Sadly, Google is not maintainig any Chrome repo with older versions, so if there is a need to install an older version of Chrome (e.g. for tests) we are dead in the water. People all over the Internet seem to be struggling to find older Chrome versions; the sparse sites hosting older Chrome versions appear and disappear not offering much of a foothold.

This repo is meant to be the solution to the problem stated above. It is hosted on GitHub and therefore unlikely to disappear. The download script present in the repo is run every hour on one of Webnicer's VPSes in order to ensure capturing each version of Chrome released to the public.

The versions 48-55 have been harvested from [Slimjet](http://www.slimjet.com/chrome/google-chrome-old-version.php). Versions 56 and up are taken directly from Google's repo.

Chrome packages stored in this repo are only for 64 bit Debian/Ubuntu. Other operating systems are beyond our interest at this point.
