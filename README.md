# chrome-downloads
Previous Chrome versions for download.

Google is not maintainig Chrome repo with older versions, so if there is a need to install older version of Chrome (e.g. for tests) we are dead in the water. I have harvested versions 48-55 from [Slimjet](http://www.slimjet.com/chrome/google-chrome-old-version.php) and put them in the repo. Versions 56 and up are taken directly from Google's repo whenever new version emerges.
